# Everest MC

Modern Minecraft Server Infrastructure

## Overview

Everest is a production-ready Minecraft server infrastructure designed for running multi-server networks. It features a Velocity proxy for player routing and Paper servers for game worlds, with automated plugin management and deployment scripts.

## Features

- **Multi-Server Architecture**: `Velocity` proxy + `Paper` game servers
- **Automated Updates**: Smart plugin and engine version management
- **Production-Ready**: `Tmux`-based process management with auto-restart
- **Plugin Management**: Auto-download and link plugins from official sources
- **Cross-Platform**: Java and Bedrock edition support via `Geyser/Floodgate`
- **Performance Optimized**: `Aikars flags` for Paper, tuned JVM settings

## Architecture

Everest uses a proxy-based architecture:

```txt
Players → Velocity Proxy (port 25565)
              ↓
         Wildy Server (Paper, port 1422)
```

The Velocity proxy handles player connections and routes them to backend Paper servers. This allows for:

- Server switching without reconnecting
- Cross-version support (`ViaVersion`)
- Bedrock edition support (`Geyser/Floodgate`)
- Centralized ban management (`LiteBans`)
