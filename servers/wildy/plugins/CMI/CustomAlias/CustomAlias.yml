#
# Edit custom variables in game if possible
# Some extra variables can be used, like [playerName] will insert senders name automatically
# All global variables should work, you can find full list in locale file
# You can add delay between commands by inserting line like
# delay! 5
# This will delay next commands by defines time in seconds
# If command is shortened and you need to provide some changing variables like target player name you need to define what and where it should be placed
# Example: /cmi heal Zrips
# Can be shortened with custom alias to something like /h zrips by using alias command like
# cmi heal $1
# If you need to add more than one variable, use $1- format. Number represents variable place when used in alias command
# Example: cmi tppos $1-
# In case you want to print out help page if player enters wrong subcommand, use ? in alias
# Example: ca ?
# In this case if player performs /ca wrongsub or /ca anotherwrong
# Commands under this alias will get executed. Exelent way to show help page and correct usage if needed
