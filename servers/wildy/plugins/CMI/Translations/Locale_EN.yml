# ***********************************************
# Some lines supports option to send them to custom places, like action bar, title, sub title or even create JSON/clickable messages
# If line starts with !toast! then player will get toast message (advancement popup, only 1.12 and up). Some extra variables can be used to define type and icon. example: !toast! -t:goal -icon:paper Hello world!
# If line starts with !actionbar! then player will get action bar message defined after this variable
# If line starts with !actionbar:[seconds]! then player will get action bar message for defined amount of time
# If line starts with !broadcast! then everyone will receive message. You can add extra !toast! !actionbar! or !title! to send message for everyone to specific place, in example !broadcast!!title!
# If line starts with !customtext:[cTextName]! then custom text will be taken by name provided and shown for player. In case its used after !broadcast! then everyone who is online will get this custom text message
# If line starts with !title! then player will get title message defined after this variable, in addition it can contain !subtitle! which will add subtitle message. Optional time can be defined with !title:4.5! which will keep title message for 4.5 seconds
# If line starts with !bossbar:[name]-[timer]! then player will get bossbar message defined after this variable, in addition you can define how long this message will be visible. You need to define bossbar name which can be anything you want, but lines with same name will override each other to prevent stacking
#
#
#
# ATTENTION! As of 9.0.0.0 CMI version some of the locale lines got moved to CMILib file. This is to centralize some of most used ones across multiple plugins.
# After you update locale in CMILib file perform `/cmil reload` command for changes to take effect

      - PlaceHolderAPI is supported for progression and text it self

        hiding
      - nameOfBar is option and when defining same one, then current bar will update
        with new information
      - 'colors can be: red, green, pink, purple, white, yellow'
      - max and current values determines bar fillup, PlaceHolderAPI variables can
        be used for dynamic updates
      - 'Examples:'
      - /cmi bossbar Notch BossBarTitle
      - /cmi bossbarmsg all -t:1s -p:%server_max_players%/%server_online% -n:testbar
        -c:red &2Title of bar %server_online%/%server_max_players% &e%cmi_user_name%
      - /cmi bossbarmsg all -p:+1 -n:testbar - will add one percent towards current
        progresion bar by name
      - /cmi bossbarmsg all -p:-1 -n:testbar - will take out one percent from current
        progresion bar by name
      - /cmi bossbarmsg all -s:10 -n:testbar - will set bossbar style to 10 segments
        by bar name
      - /cmi bossbarmsg all -sec:5 - will count for 5 seconds from 0 to 5
      - /cmi bossbarmsg all -sec:-5 - will count for 5 seconds from 5 to 0
